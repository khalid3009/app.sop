Soplang (short for Somali Programming Language) is a culturally-rooted programming language designed and developed by Mr Sharafdin (Sharafdin Yusuf Sharafdin).

It allows developers to write code in native Somali syntax using familiar keywords, expressions, and structures â€” making programming feel natural and accessible.
